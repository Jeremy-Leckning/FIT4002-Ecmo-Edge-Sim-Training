      "text_content": "<p>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a derivative of cardiopulmonary bypass in which venous blood is withdrawn from a major vein via a cannula and, in most cases, pumped through a gas exchange device to oxygenate the blood and remove carbon dioxide. This oxygenated, decarboxylated blood is then reinfused via an additional cannula into a separate vein (venovenous or VV ECMO), into an artery (venoarterial or VA ECMO), or occasionally both. Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is often used interchangeably with ECMO. However, sometimes it is meant to signify a broader term for support encompassing both VV ECMO and VA ECMO.</p><p>Major advances in technology and the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that was seen during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic have stimulated renewed interest in the use of VV ECMO as well as extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) to support the respiratory system. The use of VA ECMO in refractory cardiogenic shock and severe hemodynamic compromise has also increased, and all extracorporeal configurations are now utilized as bridging strategies to thoracic organ transplant. While technology and general care of the ECLS patient have evolved, ECLS is not without potentially serious complications and remains largely unproven as a support modality. ECMO is being tested in clinical trials to define its impact on outcomes and to establish care standards. This chapter will serve as an overview of ECMO technology and considerations for use in adults with heart-lung failure who fail conventional care. Current knowledge gaps in the field, future directions for technological improvements, and clinical applications will also be discussed.</p>",

        "text_content": "<p>Partial-to-complete cardiopulmonary support (VA ECMO) or partial-to-complete pulmonary support (VV ECMO) can be achieved depending on patient needs. In a typical circuit, venous blood is drained out of a major vein, passed through a pump and a membrane lung for gas exchange, and oxygenated blood is returned to a major artery (VA ECMO) or vein (VV ECMO) (Fig. 8.1).</p><p>An additional venous drainage cannula may be added to a circuit—venovenous-arterial (VVA) ECMO—for patients who require additional gas exchange (with primary cardiac failure) or limited hemodynamic support (with primary respiratory failure), and dual-lumen cannulae are also available for single-site respiratory support (VV dual-lumen, or VVDL). An arteriovenous (AV) extracorporeal circuit, using the patient’s own arterial pressure to drive blood across an oxygenator, as well as VV-configured circuits with pumps, can partially support the respiratory system by removing carbon dioxide.</p><p>The gas exchanger, commonly known as an oxygenator, consists of several thou- sand hollow fibers arranged in a bundle. Blood flows across the fiber bundle, and gas flows within the lumen of the individual fibers. Due to their permeability characteristics, concentration gradients between blood and gas allow the movement of oxygen into the blood as well as carbon dioxide into the fibers (Fig. 8.2).</p>",

      "text_content": "<p>As in all blood contacting devices, only hemocompatible materials with appropriate surface quality should be used. Fig. 8.3 shows a schematic ECMO circuit, exemplary velocities, and pressures in cannulas, tubing, pump, and oxygenator.</p><p>Both velocity and pressure differences are higher than in physiological flow fields, and these nonphysiological flow conditions contribute to hemocompatability differences even when surface quality is optimal.</p><p>Flow conditions in the cannula and the blood pump can activate platelets, which can lead to thrombus growth within the circuit. Inside the oxygenator itself, the comparably large fiber bundle represents a significant risk for thrombus formation because of the large foreign surface area combined with relatively low velocities [1]. Depending on the geometry of the fiber bundle, thrombi begin in different areas within the oxygenator, primarily at edges and corners distant from the inlet and outlet [2] where velocities are the lowest. The design of the inlet and outlet are therefore crucial, because it guides the blood into the fiber bundle and directs it to the outlet. High shear rates can cause hemolysis. This is most critical in cannulas and pumps due to the high blood flow velocities.</p><p>Suction of the blood vessel wall by the distal portion of the cannula may also result in hemolysis, which is minimized by multiple venous cannula inlets, which also reduces pressure loss [3]. In oxygenators, the transition from inlet area into the fiber bundle usually is the most critical for hemocompatibility. Depending on the design of the inlet and the fiber configuration, the blood might reach the first fiber layers at high velocities and hit the small gaps between the fibers, which leads to high shear rates [4]. For more information on hemocompatibility, please refer to Chapter 19.</p>",

    "text_content": "<p>High efficiency is also critical in ECMO circuit design, not only because reducing the foreign surface area improves hemocompatibility but because high efficiency min- imizes the energy, gas, and heat consumption of the entire system. This, in turn, allows for the design of smaller circuits that may facilitate mobilization and transport of patients receiving extracorporeal support. Within oxygenators, the gas exchange process can be described with the principles of diffusion and convection. In heat exchangers, the heat transfer can be described with the principles of thermal conduc- tion and convection. Diffusion follows Fick’s law, whereas thermal conduction is described by the law of Fourier, but both processes are very similar, so that the following description for gas transfer generally also applies for heat transfer.</p><p>Diffusion describes the phenomena whereby molecules move from areas of high concentration to low concentration. The higher the concentration gradient, the faster the molecules move. Applying these principles to the gas transfer inside an oxygenator, it is desirable to create high concentration gradients between the membrane and the contacting blood. On the gas side, high concentrations of oxygen with low or no carbon dioxide content are used to increase the gas exchange rate. The gas fractions inside each fiber change from the fiber inlet to its outlet due to gas exchange across the fiber. While the oxygen percentage drops, the carbon dioxide content increases. This effect reduces the gas exchange rates, especially for carbon dioxide due to its smaller con- centration gradient. To decrease this effect, the sweep gas flow can be increased. How- ever, this method is limited, because raising the sweep gas flow also increases the gas pressure inside the fibers and can theoretically lead to air bubbles penetrating the fibers and gas embolism. Another option is to apply negative pressure to the gas outlet and draw air through the fibers. This creates a negative pressure inside the fibers, which avoids air embolism [5]. Diffusion can also be improved by reducing the distance the exchanging gas must travel. For example, the smaller the space between single fibers, the shorter the diffusion paths for the particles that need to be exchanged.</p><p>The movement of particles inside liquids can be described as convection. Convec- tion plays a significant role for gas exchange in membrane contactors like oxygenators. A high flow along the gas exchanging membrane improves the gas exchange rates, because gas particles are moved away from the membrane. To increase the convective portion of exchanged gas, the velocities (of liquid and gas) should be increased. But this procedure is limited in the blood phase, because high velocities can create high shear rates and hence cause hemolysis. Additionally, a certain amount of gas per liter of blood has to be exchanged; therefore, the blood needs to remain in the oxygenator long enough to exchange a sufficient amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide. This also limits the blood flow velocity. In order to use the oxygenator to its full capacity, it has to be designed such that a uniform flow field around the gas exchanging membranes will be achieved over the entire flow range. This means that areas of recirculation (flow that primarily remains in the oxygenator), low wash out (velocities significantly lower than the average velocity), or shunt flows (blood shunts from the inlet to the outlet with little contact to gas exchanging surfaces) should be avoided. This is likewise beneficial in terms of hemocompatibility.</p>",

  "text_content": "<p>In fluid flows, the pressure loss indicates the energy that is needed to generate the flow. It is caused primarily by friction between the moving liquid and the wall that surrounds and encloses the flow as well as by internal friction of the fluid. High- pressure losses are indicative of high sheer rates [6]. Conversely, a low pressure loss is often associated with low blood trauma and allows the use of a less powerful pump requiring a lower amount of energy.</p><p>To achieve a low-pressure loss in extracorporeal circuits, one can lower the fluid’s velocity. At any given flow rate, this leads to an enlargement of the cross-sectional area where the blood flows, which, in the case of an ECMO circuit, translates into enlargement of cannula, tubing, and oxygenator. This strategy has drawbacks, however, including a large priming volume for the whole extracorporeal circuit. A large flow area leads to a larger diameter cannula, which is potentially more invasive and complication prone for the patient. Oxygenator design could be altered by varying the shape of the hollow fiber bundle to enlarge the flow area (see Fig. 8.4), but this exacerbates the demand to create a uniform flow field across the fiber bundle (see section “High efficiency”).</p>",
