# ECMO EDGE: Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Simulation Training Program

[ECMO](https://www.svhlunghealth.com.au/procedures/procedures-treatments/ecmo-extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation) is an extracorporeal technique of providing prolonged cardiac and respiratory support to persons whose heart and lungs are unable to provide an adequate amount of gas exchange or perfusion to sustain life.
The operation of ECMO is very complex which requires specialised training.

The aim of this project is to provide a comprehensive and interactive training system for apprentice clinicians learning to use the ECMO apparatus.
This is done by developing a web application, a software training suite that incorporates a textbook with interactive elements such as [Unity](https://unity.com/) 3D elements and scenario based simulated trainings, which its computations is powered by [Pulse Physiology Engine](https://pulse.kitware.com/) developed by Kitware
